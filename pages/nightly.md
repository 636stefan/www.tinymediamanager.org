You need at least Java 1.7 to run tinyMediaManager. You can get Java from [https://www.java.com/](https://www.java.com/) (Linux users can download Java from the package repository of their distribution too).

Nightly builds are automatically built every day and should only be used for hunting down bugs on **test files**. These build may contain severe bugs which can delete/destroy your test files!
