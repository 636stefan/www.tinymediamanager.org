Within the last months tinyMediaManager has constantly grown and thus we decided to do some general cleanup of the whole source to prepare it for the next months/years of development üòâ <!--more-->

1.) First of all Google Code announced to close their source code hosting service and with this step we also moved our source code to GitHub, changed the code management tool from svn to git, the build chain from ant to maven.

2.) Furthermore we‚Äôve extracted some core code needed by the scraper to its own API ([link](https://github.com/tinyMediaManager/api-scraper)) to provide an interface for 3rd party scraper developers. Hand in hand with that process we‚Äôve extracted and refactored all our scrapers to their own projects.

3.) We‚Äôve also changed our internal database engine from ObjectDb to a more maintainable (and opensource!) library H2-MVStore and JSON. This change boosted the overall performance of tinyMediaManager and is more failsafe than the old one. The drawback it, that all users have to ‚Äúimport‚Äù their library again into tinyMediaManager (update data sources)

All in all you see that in the last months there has been a lot of work with this project and now we‚Äôre proud to announce a the release of version 2.7. You can find it at [http://release.tinymediamanager.org/](http://release.tinymediamanager.org/) for Windows/MacOSX and Linux.
