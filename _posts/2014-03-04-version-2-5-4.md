There was a nasty bug in an external library with version 2.5.3 which caused our internal database to become corrupted. We've added some recovery functions, but there could be data which is lost. You can either

A) take a backup file from the backup folder inside tmm (the last one before 19.02.2014)  
B) start over with a new database by deleting the old one (menu Tools -> initialize database and rescan/update all your data sources.<!--more-->

We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by this bug!
