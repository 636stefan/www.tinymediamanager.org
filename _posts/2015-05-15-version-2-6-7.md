IMPORTANT: with tinyMediaManager version 2.7 we do not support Java6 anymore.  
If you are still using Java6, please update.  

\+ updated mediainfo to 0.7.73 (ARM users now have to install the system version of mediainfo for better compatibility)  
\+ Mirror support: TMM now distributed on several mirrors for better availability (and error handling for network blockages)  
\+ Movie renamer: complete rewrite - CHECK YOUR RENAMER SETTINGS!  
\+ Movie renamer: possible to "downgrade" a movie, when having no distinct folder. (CHECK YOUR FOLDER RENAMER SETTINGS!)
